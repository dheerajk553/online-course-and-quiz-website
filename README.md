##  Learning Reflection

This project helped me apply full-stack development skills in a real-world context. I focused on originality, academic integrity, and practical implementation. From backend logic to frontend design, every step was manually built and documented. It reflects my commitment to hands-on learning and building something that can be applied in real life.
